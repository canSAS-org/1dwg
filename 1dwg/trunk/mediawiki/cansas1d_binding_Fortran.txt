The development of the FORTRAN language, so beloved of scientists, pre-dates the development of XML.  And it shows.  FORTRAN is not a language that manipulates strings with ease, and this makes parsing XML decidedly awkward.  So unless you ''really'' have to use FORTRAN, you are probably better off with C/C++ (or something else more 'modern'), see for example Daniel Veillard's LIBXML2 library at http://xmlsoft.org/ or Frank van den Berghen's parser at http://www.applied-mathematics.net/tools/xmlParser.html.

If you have to use a dialect earlier than FORTRAN-90 (F90), then the chances are you will have to code your own parser.

== Software Development Kits ==
For later dialects, there are some SDK's available on the Web:

* F90:
** XMLPARSE - by Arjen Markus at http://xml-fortran.sourceforge.net/
** FoX - by Toby White & others at http://uszla.me.uk/space/software/FoX/
* For F95:
** XML - by Mart Rentmeester at http://nn-online.org/code/xml/

== canSAS 1-D SAS XML v1.0 support ==
Steve King[mailto:s.m.king@rl.ac.uk] (ISIS) has provided a F77 routine ([http://svn.smallangles.net/trac/canSAS/browser/1dwg/trunk/fortran/SASXML_G77.F SASXML_G77.F]) that will read CanSAS XML v1.0 files.
