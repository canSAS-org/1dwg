(see: http://www.cansas.org/formats/canSAS1d/1.1/doc/)

The canSAS1d data format is used to communicate one-dimensional 
reduced small-angle scattering data. It is a text format and is 
based on XML.  For more information, see: http://www.cansas.org

For multi-dimensional data, 
[NXcanSAS](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/classes/applications/NXcanSAS.html)
is recommended.  The **NXcanSAS** standard can store reduced small-angle scattering 
data of *any* dimension in [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org) files based on the
[NeXus data format](http://nexusformat.org).
